title: "The Tech Behind This Site"
---

When I set out to create this site, I knew I wanted some technology that made it
easy for me to write posts in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). One of my first
thoughts was to set up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), create a
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site and write away. Ultimately, I decided on
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
