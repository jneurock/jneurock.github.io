# rocky.codes

This codebase powers my professional website [rocky.codes](https://rocky.codes).

The purpose of this site is for people to get to know me and how I approach
software development. Check out the [My Approach](https://rocky.codes/apprach)
page to get more insight into how I work.

### Tech Note

This is a very small-scale [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.com) project. Thereâ€™s
probably not much to learn from perusing the code but feel free. The one custom
feature I added is the color mode toggle component.
